# 1.0.0 (2018-04-12)

### Features

* **module:readme-inspector:** Verify the existence—and assess the quality—of README files

  > ![quote][octicon-quote] READMEs do more than explain how to use your project. They also
  > explain why your project matters, and what your users can do with it.
  >
  > In your README, try to answer the following questions:
  >
  > * What does this project do?
  > * Why is this project useful?
  > * How do I get started?
  > * Where can I get more help, if I need it?
  >
  > You can use your README to answer other questions, like how you handle
  > contributions, what the goals of the project are, and information about
  > licenses and attribution. If you don’t want to accept contributions, or
  > your project is not yet ready for production, write this information down. <sup><a href="#ref-1" title="View reference.">[1]</a></sup>
